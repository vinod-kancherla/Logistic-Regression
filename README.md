 Programming assignment of Course 1 of the Deep Learning Specialization! by DeepLearning.AI 

 # In this assignment I built a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats (meow!). This assignment will step  through how to do this with a Neural Network mindset, and so will also hone intuitions about deep learning. At the end of this notebook, I am able to recognize and classify Catelyn Stark as as cat/not cat (meow?).
